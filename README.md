Data behind The Paper's story, "Where did Meteorites Fall on the Earth?"
https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_2175730

We cleaned data from the Meteoritical Bulletin Database, which is updated by June 2018. The dataset includes eight columns: name, abbreviation, status, year, city, country, mass(kg), latitutde, and longtitude.
One thing to note, since we wanted to build a map to show the mass of various meteorites, we have deleted the ones without clear geographic info or mass data. 

If you have any questions, please contact zoumy@thepaper.cn. Enjoy! :)
